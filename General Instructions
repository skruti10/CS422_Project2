For each contributor there is a section in <body> for html code and <script> for js- please use only your blocks to defined any code - hmtl/js.
Maintain a local copy of the entire html file taken from the git.
Do your code changes in your block, do not disturb any other code block of any other coder.
Once you are done with your changes and want to commit, please take the latest first, in that latest copy just remove your code block
and add your latest code block. No conflicts will occur and it will save our time and no overwriting of the code will happen.
Copy all your image icons in the Icon folder.
Use absolute path for using any images.
For every variable/function names please use ur initial and then follow camel casing for naming convention. 
Example : kMenuIcon - icon defined for menu by Kruti (initial => k)
Do not give x and y for each image icons, try to define a rectangle - this rectangle should be in reference with its above rectangle or
in reference with the door.
Put all ur image icons in this rectangle with their x and y defined with respect to this. Whenever you want to move the entire set of 
icons, you can just add value to the rectangles top and left - it will be automatically reflected in the others - you will not need to 
shift each icon manually. At the end we can remove the border of this rectangle and fill it with same color as background.
